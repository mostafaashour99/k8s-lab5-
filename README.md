    1-  Create a namespace haproxy-controller-devops.

    2-  Create a ServiceAccount haproxy-service-account-devops under the same namespace.

    3-  Create a ClusterRole which should be named as haproxy-cluster-role-devops, to grant
        permissions "get", "list", "watch", "create", "patch", "update" to
        "Configmaps",”secrets”,"endpoints","nodes","pods","services",
        "namespaces","events","serviceaccounts".

    4-  Create a ClusterRoleBinding which should be named as
        haproxy-cluster-role-binding-devops under the same namespace. Define roleRef apiGroup
        should be rbac.authorization.k8s.io, kind should be ClusterRole, name should be
        haproxy-cluster-role-devops and subjects kind should be ServiceAccount, name should be
        haproxy-service-account-devops and namespace should be haproxy-controller-devops.


    5-  Create a backend deployment which should be named as backend-deployment-devops
        under the same namespace, labels run should be ingress-default-backend under metadata.
        Configure spec as replica should be 1, selector's matchLabels run should be
        ingress-default-backend. Template's labels run under metadata should be
        ingress-default-backend. The container should named as backend-container-devops, use
        image gcr.io/google_containers/defaultbackend:1.0 ( use exact name of image as
        mentioned ) and its containerPort should be 8080.

    6-  Create a service for backend which should be named as service-backend-devops under
        the same namespace, labels run should be ingress-default-backend. Configure spec as
        selector's run should be ingress-default-backend, port should be named as port-backend,
        protocol should be TCP, port should be 8080 and targetPort should be 8080.

    7-  Create a deployment for frontend which should be named haproxy-ingress-devops
        under the same namespace. Configure spec as replica should be 1, selector's matchLabels
        should be haproxy-ingress, template's labels run should be haproxy-ingress under
        metadata. The container name should be ingress-container-devops under the same service
        account haproxy-service-account-devops, use image haproxytech/kubernetes-ingress, give
        args as --default-backend-service=haproxy-controller-devops/service-backend-devops,
        resources requests for cpu should be 500m and for memory should be 50Mi, livenessProbe
        httpGet path should be /healthz its port should be 1024. The first port name should be http
        and its containerPort should be 80, second port name should be https and its
        containerPort should be 443 and third port name should be stat its containerPort should
        be 1024. Define environment as first env name should be TZ its value should be Etc/UTC,
        second env name should be POD_NAME itsvalueFrom:
        fieldRef:
        fieldPath: should be metadata.name and third env name should be POD_NAMESPACE
        its
        valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
        fieldPath: should be metadata.namespace.


    8-  Create a service for frontend which should be named as ingress-service-devops under
        same namespace, labels run should be haproxy-ingress. Configure spec as selectors' run
        should be haproxy-ingress, type should be NodePort. The first port name should be http,
        its port should be 80, protocol should be TCP, targetPort should be 80 and nodePort should
        be 32456. The second port name should be https, its port should be 443, protocol should
        be TCP, targetPort should be 443 and nodePort should be 32567. The third port name
        should be stat, its port should be 1024, protocol should be TCP, targetPort should be 1024
        and nodePort should be 32678.
